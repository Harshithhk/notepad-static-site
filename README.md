## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:
- **Terraform**: Install Terraform
- **AWS CLI**: Install AWS CLI and Configure AWS Credentials

## Terraform Configuration
The Terraform files in this repository will create the following AWS resources:
- **S3 Bucket**: An S3 bucket to store the static website files.
- **S3 Bucket Policy**: A public-read policy to make the website accessible.
- **S3 Bucket Versioning**: Enabled to keep a history of your objects.
- **S3 Website Configuration**: Configured to serve index.html as the main page.

## How to Deploy the Infrastructure
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

2. **Update Terraform variables:**
Modify the `terraform-dev.tfvars` file with your desired domain_name and bucket_name.
```hcl
domain_name = "your-domain.com"
bucket_name = "your-bucket-name.com"
```

3. **Initialize Terraform:**
```bash
terraform init
```

4. **Plan the deployment:**
```bash
terraform plan -var-file="terraform-dev.tfvars"
```

5. **Apply the configuration:**
```bash
terraform apply -var-file="terraform-dev.tfvars" --auto-approve
```

After applying, Terraform will output the website endpoint URL.
